      We will make Gig City Elixir a diverse experience. We will have
      scholarships available to those under-represented in our programming
      community including women and minorities. We will do the mentoring it
      takes before the conference to make sure programmers can take full
      advantage. If you or someone you know might benefit and can't afford their
      own ticket, let us know.
