        Easily allured by puzzles of any kind. Annieâ€™s BS in mathematics from
        UNC and brief career in education taught her that seemingly impossible
        problems often have beautiful solutions. She brings that optimism to
        each new programming challenge she faces. At Viget, Annie writes Ruby
        and appreciates the little things, such as thoughtful variable names and
        well-structured databases. She loves bar trivia, board games, and
        finding new puzzles to solve.
