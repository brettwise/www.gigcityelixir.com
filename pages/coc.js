          Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar
          activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In
          particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities,
          or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use
          sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a
          sexualized environment.

          If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers
